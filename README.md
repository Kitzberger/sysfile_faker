sys_file faker
==============

Once installed and enabled this TYPO3 extension creates dummy image files (jpg, png, gif) when trying to read a sys_file_references in case the referenced sys_file record lost its file.

Only recommended for development contexts. Don't use this experimental extension on production systems.
